# Speaker Details

This project implements a feature that allows users to view detailed information about a speaker in a modal or popover. The user interacts with a slider displaying speaker cards, and by clicking on a speaker card, they can access more detailed information about the speaker in an interactive popover. The popover can be dismissed by clicking a close button.
